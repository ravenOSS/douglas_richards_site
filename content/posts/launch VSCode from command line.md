# Launch VSCode with "code" command

To launch VSCode from the command line open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and type "shell command" to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.

You may now launch VSCode from the command line by typing "code ." in the directory you want to open.

If you want to open a specific file, you can type "code filename" in the directory you want to open.

If you have the old code alias in your .bash_profile from an early VSCode version, remove it and replace it by executing the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.
