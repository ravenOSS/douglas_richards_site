The process of getting started with git is a bit of a challenge.

The example provided by Github simply does not reflect how users employ git.

Simplified workflow for getting started with git:

- Choose a project name
- Create a new project folder either automatically such as with Create React App (CRA) or manually
- Create a new git repository
