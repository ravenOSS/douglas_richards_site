This is a simple example of how to use it with local and remote files.

The docs for the Next Image component treat local and remote image separately. This is how to deal with the issue.

- Define image path in the `src` attribute.
- Define image url
- Define image loader

**_This does not work when deployed._**
Setting the parameters in the next.config.js file means that all images are still prepended with the url. The pages will render with the local image but there will be a placeholder for the remote image that does not exist.

```
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
	images: {
		domains: ['res.cloudinary.com'],
	},
	webpack: (cfg) => {
		cfg.module.rules.push({
			test: /\.md$/,
			loader: 'frontmatter-markdown-loader',
			options: { mode: ['react-component'] },
		})
		return cfg
	},
	reactStrictMode: true,
}

// loader: 'cloudinary',
// path: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/raveniot/image/upload/',
```

Note that the 'loader: 'cloudinary' is not required. Just the cloudinary domain is sufficient.

Example of using the Image component with local files. In this next example for a footer component, the image is stored in the public folder.

```
import Image from 'next/image'
import nextLogo from '../public/nextjsBlackLogo.svg'

export default function Footer() {
	return (
		<div className='flex items-center content-end min-w-full px-12 py-4 '>
			{/* <div className='flex items-center content-end min-w-full px-12 py-4 bg-gray-300 border-t-2 border-orange-400'> */}
			<div className='mr-auto text-sm font-semibold text-gray-600'>

			<Image
				// className='pr-6'
				src={nextLogo}
				width={75}

				alt='Next.js'
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```
