This thoroughly unconventional building was photographed by Pierre Ch√¢tel-Innocenti.

Designed and built over four decades ago in Portencia, Italy, the porthole fascia echoes the mass of the structure. Buttresses on either side visually anchor the drum to its site and counteracts the sense that it may roll away.
