how to use apolloConsumer in react native?

The ApolloConsumer component in the react-apollo library allows you to manually fetch data from your GraphQL server and also to perform mutations.

To use ApolloConsumer in React Native, you first need to install the react-apollo package and the apollo-client package. You can install them using npm:

```js
npm install --save react-apollo apollo-client
Once you have installed the packages, you can import the ApolloConsumer component from react-apollo:
```

```js
import { ApolloConsumer } from 'react-apollo'
```

Then, you can use ApolloConsumer in your component like this:

```js
<ApolloConsumer>
	{(client) => (
		<View>
			<Button
				onPress={() =>
					client.query({
						query: YOUR_QUERY_HERE,
						variables: { YOUR_VARIABLES_HERE },
					})
				}
				title='Fetch Data'
			/>
		</View>
	)}
</ApolloConsumer>
```

In the above code, we have wrapped a Button component inside ApolloConsumer. When the button is pressed, the client.query() function is called, which fetches the data from the GraphQL server based on the provided query and variables.

You can also use ApolloConsumer to perform mutations:

```js
<ApolloConsumer>
	{(client) => (
		<View>
			<Button
				onPress={() =>
					client.mutate({
						mutation: YOUR_MUTATION_HERE,
						variables: { YOUR_VARIABLES_HERE },
					})
				}
				title='Perform Mutation'
			/>
		</View>
	)}
</ApolloConsumer>
```

In the above code, we have wrapped a Button component inside ApolloConsumer. When the button is pressed, the client.mutate() function is called, which performs the mutation based on the provided mutation and variables.

Note that you should only use ApolloConsumer when you need to manually fetch data or perform mutations. In most cases, you should use the Query and Mutation components provided by react-apollo instead.

The latest version of Apollo uses @apollo client that includes the react hooks. How is ApolloConsumer used in the latest version of Apollo in react native

With the latest version of Apollo (version 3.0 or higher), the recommended approach for using Apollo in React Native is to use the React hooks provided by the @apollo/client package instead of ApolloConsumer.

However, if you still need to use ApolloConsumer for some reason, you can import it from @apollo/client and use it in your component like this:

```js
import {
	ApolloClient,
	ApolloProvider,
	ApolloConsumer,
	InMemoryCache,
} from '@apollo/client'

const client = new ApolloClient({
	uri: YOUR_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,
	cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})

function MyComponent() {
	const handleFetchData = async (client) => {
		const { data } = await client.query({
			query: YOUR_QUERY_HERE,
			variables: { YOUR_VARIABLES_HERE },
		})
		console.log(data)
	}

	return (
		<ApolloProvider client={client}>
			<View>
				<ApolloConsumer>
					{(client) => (
						<Button
							onPress={() => handleFetchData(client)}
							title='Fetch Data'
						/>
					)}
				</ApolloConsumer>
			</View>
		</ApolloProvider>
	)
}
```

In the above example, we have created an Apollo client and wrapped our component with the ApolloProvider component, passing the client as a prop. Inside our component, we have used ApolloConsumer to get access to the client instance, which we then use to fetch data with a query.

Note that this is not the recommended approach for using Apollo in React Native, as it's generally better to use the React hooks provided by @apollo/client instead of ApolloConsumer. The useQuery and useMutation hooks make it much easier and more intuitive to fetch data and perform mutations in your components.

So, ApolloConsumer has to be wrapped in ApolloProvider?

Yes, that's correct. In order to use ApolloConsumer, you need to wrap your component tree with ApolloProvider, which provides an instance of ApolloClient to your components via the React context API.

Here's an example of how to wrap your component tree with ApolloProvider:

```js
import {
	ApolloClient,
	ApolloProvider,
	ApolloConsumer,
	InMemoryCache,
} from '@apollo/client'

const client = new ApolloClient({
	uri: YOUR_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,
	cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})

function App() {
	return (
		<ApolloProvider client={client}>
			<View>
				{/* Your components go here */}
				<ApolloConsumer>{/* Use ApolloConsumer here */}</ApolloConsumer>
			</View>
		</ApolloProvider>
	)
}
```

In this example, we have created an instance of ApolloClient and passed it to ApolloProvider as a prop. Then, we have wrapped our component tree with ApolloProvider and included an ApolloConsumer inside the tree.

The ApolloConsumer component will then have access to the ApolloClient instance provided by ApolloProvider, which it can use to fetch data or perform mutations.

It's important to note that you should only use ApolloConsumer when you need to manually fetch data or perform mutations. In most cases, you should use the React hooks provided by @apollo/client, such as useQuery and useMutation, instead. These hooks are much easier to use and provide a more intuitive API for fetching data and performing mutations in your components.

I have two apollo clients for different endpoints. Therefore, I cannot use a single client as a prop to ApolloProvider. If I use the react hooks, how do I set up different clients for various components

If you have multiple GraphQL endpoints and need to use different Apollo clients for different components, you can create multiple instances of ApolloClient and pass them as props to separate ApolloProvider components.

Here's an example of how to set up multiple clients and providers:

```js
import { ApolloClient, ApolloProvider, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'

const client1 = new ApolloClient({
	uri: YOUR_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT_1,
	cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})

const client2 = new ApolloClient({
	uri: YOUR_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT_2,
	cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})

function MyComponent1() {
	const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(YOUR_QUERY, { client: client1 })

	// Render your component using the fetched data
}

function MyComponent2() {
	const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(YOUR_QUERY, { client: client2 })

	// Render your component using the fetched data
}

function App() {
	return (
		<>
			<ApolloProvider client={client1}>
				<MyComponent1 />
			</ApolloProvider>
			<ApolloProvider client={client2}>
				<MyComponent2 />
			</ApolloProvider>
		</>
	)
}
```

In this example, we have created two instances of ApolloClient for two different GraphQL endpoints, and passed them as props to separate ApolloProvider components. We have also used the useQuery hook to fetch data for each component, passing the relevant client as an option.

Note that when using multiple Apollo clients, you need to specify the client option when using the useQuery hook, in order to tell Apollo which client to use for the query.

You can use this same approach to set up multiple clients and providers for any other Apollo hooks, such as useMutation, useLazyQuery, and so on. Simply pass the relevant client as the client option when using the hook.
