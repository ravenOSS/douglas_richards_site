Appearing to be from a science fiction outer planet settlement, this building has been carefully designed to maximize outdoor living and ocean views while metal shutters insulate residents from Spains's Malaga city center noise.

Designed by Rodrigo Sevilla, an architect from Barcelona, this building seems to echo London's "Gerkin" while providing pragmatic living spaces in a hot summer climate.
